    "#### A Quick Refresher on Generative models\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can understasnd GANs, it is important to refresh our memories on what generative models are and how they are different from the classic discriminative methods we have been working with so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall the typicall paradigm of discriminative model has been to create a model that learns some conditional probability distribution $P(y|x)$ where $x$ is some input data and $y$ are your set of output labels. Essentially we are tring to find the probability of some label $y$ given some never before seen data $x$. Generative models however are different, these models seek to learn the joint probability distribution $P(x,y)$ of some data. In layman terms, we are essentially assuming that our data and label comes from some probability distribution and with this assumption in mind we can use this probability to generate samples from this same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most powerful feature of GANs and generative models as whole. The ability to create high quality data samples is a very powerful, and GANs have many applications based on this, from the creation of art, generation of realistic human faces, and more. \n",
